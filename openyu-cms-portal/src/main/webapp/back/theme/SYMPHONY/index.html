  <h2><a name="welcome"></a>welcome</h2>
  <div>
   Hello and welcome to my I think 4th design for <acronym title="Open Source Web Design">OSWD</acronym>. 
   It's loosely based on my previous design, Altitude, although
   with the addition of the RHS bar.<br /><br />
   
   Some credits etc: at some points I've become slightly stuck when <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> comes up with stupid, niggly little problems that
   drive my crazy. I am therefore <acronym title="BT2 was partially helped into being by my ^orange in the mist^">
   reciprocally crediting</acronym> Linus' Blue Tranquility 2 for helping with the problem of the content div disappearing
   when the screen size goes below 800x600. Haran's Sinorca, as ever, also deserves a mention for the sub-nav system.<br /><br />
   
   I anticipate this site being used for business purposes, mainly because of the extensive navigation facilities available
   but also because it is quite formal. I anticipate that many users will use the navigation on the side bars for main
   navigation, rather than page navigation as I have shown here.<br /><br />
   
   If you use this template, could you please leave the notice at the top of the script about the design, as well as
   the item in the footer. It would also be great if you could email me your site's URL. Thank you!
  </div>
 
 
  <h2><a name="script"></a>about the scripting</h2>
  <div>
   This website is scripted in XHTML 1.0 Strict. I've used <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets v2">CSS 2</acronym> to define
   all the styles.<br /><br />
   
   One of the most interesting features of this website is that it is tableless. After a long struggle, the
   <acronym title="Right-hand side info bar">RHS bar</acronym> now works correctly all the time, something that I
   have previously found very difficult to achieve without reverting back to tables.<br /><br />
   
   The coding is quite logical to update etc (at least to my mind!), with the built in styles used wherever possible as
   opposed to creating loads and loads of new classes.
  </div>
  
  
  <h2><a name="access"></a>accessibility</h2>
  <div>
   Symphony works with <acronym title="Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2">IE</acronym>, Mozilla Firefox v1 and Opera 7.53.
   In Opera, title font sizes appear quite small but you alter this if you wished.<br /><br />
   
   Symphony has been designed to flow logically, although to date I haven't checked it against any standards. I have
   included additional features, such as tags within the page that will display if 
   <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> is turned off, and to indicate
   to non-visual agents what section is which. This is partly helped by the built-in heading tags.
  </div>
  
  
  <h2><a name="styles"></a>stylesheets</h2>
  <div>
   Symphony uses the one stylesheet for screen display, style-screen.css. Because of the complexity of
   certain global styles, you will see in the stylesheet that I have created some definitions that enable you to change
   certain key style elements which take effect across the entire website.<br /><br />
   
   Also included is a print stylesheet, style-print.css. This renders the page without the side bars when printed.
   However, if you include this with your website, please ensure that you tell your users in some way why certain 
   elements have disappeared! I also suggest that you check it out for yourself before including it, so that you can see
   whether or not it is suitable for your purposes.
